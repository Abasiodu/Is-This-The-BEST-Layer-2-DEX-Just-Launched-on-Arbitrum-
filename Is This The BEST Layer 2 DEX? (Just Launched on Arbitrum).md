# Integral Size: The New Decentralized Exchange on Arbitrum 🚀

In this video, we'll explore a newly launched decentralized exchange (DEX) on Arbitrum that has the potential to become the best Layer 2 DEX available. While this is a sponsored video, the aim is to inform you about Integral Size and why it matters for the future of trading.

## Why This Matters 🤔

### The Future of Layer 2 Blockchains 🌐
- **Scalability:** Layer 2 solutions are essential for scaling Ethereum, providing fast and affordable transactions.
- **User Experience:** Layer 2 DEXs like Integral Size aim to offer a superior trading experience compared to Ethereum’s current DEXs (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap).

### Challenges with Early Layer 2 Adoption 🚧
- **Liquidity Issues:** Early Layer 2 DEXs often have lower liquidity than their Ethereum counterparts, leading to higher slippage.
- **Adoption Barriers:** Higher slippage and price impact can hinder the adoption of Layer 2 networks.

## Introducing Integral Size 🆕

### What is Integral Size? 📈
- **Objective:** To minimize slippage and price impact on trades, even for large transactions.
- **Approach:** Utilizes a unique Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) model and executes trades against its own liquidity pools.

### How Integral Size Works 🔄
- **TWAP Model:** Splits large trades into smaller orders over time to minimize market impact.
- **Execution:** Uses an external Oracle to determine a 30-minute average price from Uniswap and trades against Integral's own liquidity.

### Key Benefits 💡
1. **Zero Price Impact:** Large trades do not affect the market price.
2. **Zero Slippage:** Trades executed at an average price from external markets.
3. **Protection Against Front Running:** 30-minute delay prevents front running by arbitrage bots.

## Integral Size vs. Competitors 🏆
- **Distinct Approach:** Unlike DEX aggregators, Integral Size executes trades against its own liquidity, ensuring minimal impact on external markets.
- **User Experience:** Aims to offer a fair, secure, and transparent trading environment.

## Track Record and Roadmap 📅
- **Integral 5:** Previous DEX on Ethereum with $500 million in trading volume, providing valuable insights for Integral Size.
- **Future Plans:** Expanding to other Layer 2 solutions, adding limit orders, supporting more token pairs, and integrating an atomic relayer.

## Institutional Adoption Potential 🏛️
- **Addressing Issues:** Integral Size aims to solve problems that have deterred institutions from using DeFi, such as high trading costs, security concerns, and compliance issues.

## Areas for Improvement 🚀
- **Execution:** Timely execution of the roadmap is crucial.
- **Growth:** Needs to grow liquidity, volume, and trading activity steadily.
- **Security:** Building a strong track record without security incidents is essential.
